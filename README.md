# Overview
In this course you will create an AI Chatbot to analyze a PDF file that you uploaded as the main feature of this Chatbot, natural language processing, in the sense (NLP) used in this Chatbot is an LLM API from OpenAI GPT 3.5 which will be language processing of uploaded PDFs.

# Large Language Model (LLM)
Large Language Models (LLM), or Large Language Models, are the latest achievements in the field of artificial intelligence that utilize machine learning technology to understand and generate text with a high level of complexity. The LLM brings the unique ability to process and understand linguistic context in multiple languages, as well as produce text that is often difficult to distinguish from human writing.
Using deep learning techniques and very large model architectures, LLM can tackle tasks such as language translation, creative text generation, and understanding context in natural language. The model is trained on incredibly large amounts of data, enabling it to recognize complex patterns and store knowledge across domains.

# Flask
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, known for its simplicity and speed. A web framework is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including the creation of web servers, and the management of HTTP requests and responses.
We will use Flask to create the server side or back-end of this chatbot. This involves handling incoming messages from the user, processing the messages, and sending appropriate responses back to the user.
In Flask, routes are created using the @app.route decorator to associate a function with a URL route. When a user visits that URL, the corresponding function is executed. In our chatbot project, we will use routes to handle POST requests that carry user messages and process document data.

# LangChain
Langchain is a versatile tool for building artificial intelligence (AI) based language applications. It provides various functionalities such as text search, summarization, translation, and more, by leveraging pre-trained language models. In this project, we will integrate Langchain into our chatbot, empowering it to understand and respond effectively to various user inputs.

# ChatBot
Chatbots are software applications designed to communicate like humans. They can respond to text input from users and are widely used in a variety of fields, including customer service, e-commerce, and education. In this project, you will build a chatbot that is capable of not only interacting with users in general conversations, but also answering questions based on specific documents.

# HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT
This class has provided a ready-to-use chatbot interface, built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML builds the structure of web content, CSS decorates it, and Javascript adds interactivity. These technologies create chatbot interfaces that are visually appealing and interactive.


# Required

- Python
- Flask (Framework web berbasis Python)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript dasar
